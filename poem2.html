    For Keeps
    
    By: Joy Harjo

   <pre class="poem-two">
    Sun
    makes
    the
    day
    new.
    Tiny
    green
    plants
    emerge
    from
    earth.
    Birds
    are
    singing
    the
    sky
    into
    place.
    There
    is
    nowhere
    else
    I
    want 
    to
    be
    but
    here.
    I
    lean
    into
    the
    rhythm
    of
    your
    heart
    to
    see
    where
    it
    will
    take
    us.
    We
    gallop
    into
    a
    warm,
    southern
    wind.
    I
    link 
    my
    legs
    to
    yours
    and
    we
    ride
    together,
    Toward
    the
    ancient
    encampment
    of
    our
    relatives.
    Where
    have
    you
    been?
    they
    ask.
    And
    what
    has
    taken
    you
    so
    long?
    That
    night
    after
    eating,
    singing,
    and
    dancing
    We
    lay
    together
    under
    the
    stars.
    We
    know
    ourselves
    to
    be
    part
    of
    mystery.
    It
    is 
    unspeakable.
    It
    is
    everlasting.
    It
    is
    for
    keeps.
