    Artist Statement:

    “Daisy” is a stop motion, claymation style animation. The animation uses bright colors and a written narrative to provide a
    narration for the story. The age group that would be interested in this type of animation is broad. On one hand, the style
    takes some inspiration from children’s television shows, and could be popular with a young audience because of this. However,
    it also provides a cute, relatable character and could be nostalgic toward days when the viewers watched children’s television
    shows for older watchers. The goal is to evoke happiness from the viewers by showing a quirky character and a “feel good” storyline.
    At the end of each of the four episodes, Daisy comes up with a solution to a problem that she has, or she faces a fear. The viewers
    don’t need to feel tense or worried watching the story because of this. Additionally, the wind and rain sounds could provide a soothing
    feeling for the viewer (even if they scare Daisy!). The character is inspired by my dog in real life. I have a terrier who hides whenever
    there are high winds or there is rain, barks at the mailwoman, and is scared of her peers at the dog park. Daisy in real life isn’t as much
    of a problem solver or as brave as Daisy in the claymation. This is where the storyline of the animation starts to become unrealistic, just
    like the art style. This gives it an element of fantasy/magic that makes it fun and appealing for viewers of any age and gives them a warm, happy feeling.
