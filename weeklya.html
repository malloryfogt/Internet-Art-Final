Weekly a
September 2, 2023
The last couple of weeks we learned the basics of writing text in html. I
think that the most difficult part of learning html is remembering what
tags mean what, and debugging when something goes wrong. We also learned
how to link pages, add images using the href command, which is probably
the most difficult concept for me that we have learned so far, but
manageable.
I am having a problem where if I make one line of text bold, all of the
text on the page is bold, and I am struggling to fix. I tried to find a
solution online but could not manage to figure it out. The other thing
that I am struggling with is fixing my code, when there are certain lines
of code that are flagged by visual studio code with a red dot. The code is
still running, but it says 'breakpoint' with a red dot. I am not sure if
this is something I should be concerned about. Other than these things, it
is going fairly smoothly.
