    <p id="paragraph-2"> This week we turned in Exercise 1 and started
        learning about CSS styling. We learned about changing
        font size and color, creating ids and classes, and
        creating style sheets. We also leaned how to create 
        folders to organize our files. 

        </p>
        
        
        <p id= "paragraph-4"> For my exercise 1, I created
        a page with images, and links to other pages teaching
        users how to make friendship bracelets. I learned a lot
        by working on this exercise and got a lot of practice
        with h ref commands and adding photos to pages. I am 
        wondering if it is possible to put .heic files
        into visual studio code, because I could not
        get that to work, and I had to convert my heic files
        to png files. One thing that I always forget to do is change the title for the tab at the top
        of the page. I am also still experimenting with the 
        spacing for the margin and padding and figuring
        out what looks the best.
        As time goes on I hope to be able to code more
        naturally without checking my notes every time I write a new
        line.
