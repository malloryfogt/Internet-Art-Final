        Weekly H   November 16, 2023


        This week we started learning some Java. We learned about if-else statements, random
        statements, and drawing shapes such as elipses and squares. We also learned how
        to make the shapes move, and change the colors of them. I tried to incorporate this into 
        my Drawing with Code exercise. I had a lot of fun experimenting with this, especially with
        changing the colors of the shapes. In unrelated news, its getting cold outside, which makes
        me excited for Thanksgiving and the winter holidays that are coming up!!!
