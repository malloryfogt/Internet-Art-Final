    Artist Statement:

    This work shows a robot character who is curious about human-kind. After reading a
    magazine about human life, they are inspired and want to become human themselves.
    After reading up on what makes a human, they learn that the true way to become human
    is to use your brain and you heart. To create the head of the robot I photographed a
    shoebox wrapped in foil from various angles. For the body of the robot I used photos
    of myself to create the body of the robot. Fun fact: The humans on the magazine in
    the first image are my grandparents at their high school prom!
