    Weekly C   September 17, 2023

<pre class="paragraphTwo">

    This week we learned more about css styling. I am making progress on my 5 variations
    assignment and I am working on learning new ways to take css styling to the next level.
    I think one of the most difficult parts of writing html is remmbering how to format the code
    correctly. The thing that I am most confused about right now is adjusting margins, padding and
    box-sizing. Hopefully as time goes on I will start to gain a better understanding of this.

    This week we had a class presentation about the World Wide Web. I learned about the history
    of the internet, and rules other countries have about the internet.
