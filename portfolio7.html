    Artist Statement:

    This piece is inspired by phosphenes that I saw as I was trying to fall asleep as a young child. The fun, upbeat music, cartoonish birds,
    and rainbow colors create a fun, “child-like” mood. Between the main “shapes”, I have created a metamorphosis style animation using Photoshop.
    The blur effect makes the phosphenes feel more realistic because many people rub their eyes and rubbing your eyes creates a blur. The “blurs”
    also represent deep breathing as I fall asleep. There is a dark colored background to represent the inside of my eyelid, and the bright pink
    flashes represent when I open my eyes for a moment. They also accent the music.
