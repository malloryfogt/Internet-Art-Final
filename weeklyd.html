This week we focused a lot on Exercise 2, the five variations assignment. This
assignment helped me a lot because it provided the chance for me to experiment
with what we have learned in class. I experimented a lot with pre text and different
ways that text can be arranged in them. I feel that I have a better understanding of
how to obtain texts from Google Fonts and use them in my html code. I am also more 
comfortable with using css style sheets and classes in my code. I also thought is was very
helpful to see other peoples code and examples in class, because it gave me ideas of things
I could try for my next project. For example, I learned a little about text animation
and dropdown menus and using sound from seeing other's work in our in-class critique. I think
that the most time consuming part of this project was using trial and error to make
sure that the pre-text looks the way that I wanted it to. Overall, I thought this was a very
fun assignment!
