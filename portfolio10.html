    Artist Statement:

    These pieces use beauty projects in an unconventional way.
    While the products are pink and are traditionally associated with
    femininity and beauty they are mixed with a green, toxic, bubbly substance.
    This is supposed to represent the downsides of beauty and the poor self-image
    that people try to cover up with things like makeup.
